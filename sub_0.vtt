the Almighty is...

08:30.877 --> 08:32.679

in his own hands?

08:32.712 --> 08:34.914
Senator, with all due respect,
God's not part

08:34.948 --> 08:36.616
of the equation, no.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.951
What I mean is that,

08:37.984 --> 08:40.687
in the last century,
we amassed, uh,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.689
landmark technological power,

08:42.722 --> 08:45.358
and we've consistently
proven ourselves incapable

08:45.392 --> 08:46.893
of handling that power.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.862
80 years ago,
who could have predicted

08:48.895 --> 08:51.197
nuclear proliferation?
But then there it was.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.732
And now we've got
genetic power.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.067

08:54.100 --> 08:56.102

around the globe,

08:56.136 --> 08:58.905

gonna be done with it?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.941
It ain't gonna stop with the
de-extinction of the dinosaurs.

he wanted someone young
and, uh, idealistic

13:19.666 --> 13:23.203
to spend his fortune...
and I used to be both.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.371
(laughs)

13:24.404 --> 13:26.373
Follow me.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.209
Let me give you
a bit of history.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.044
This is where it all began.

13:31.077 --> 13:34.147
Before the island, Sorna,
Jurassic Park, all of it.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.449
Hammond and Lockwood
built a custom lab

13:36.483 --> 13:39.319
in the subbasement,
extracted the first DNA

13:39.352 --> 13:41.454
from amber
right beneath our feet.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.456
(laughs):
Oh, my goodness.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.226
What they did here
was a miracle.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.961
I still believe that.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.397
So do I, Claire. So do I.

13:50.430 --> 13:54.234
And I still believe it matters
what happens to those animals.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.969
There is something

13:56.002 --> 13:58.471
Mr. Lockwood would very much
like you to do, Claire.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.408
You can call it a favor
for an old friend.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.444
We have a piece of land.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.681
A sanctuary protected
by natural barriers,

14:07.714 --> 14:09.416
fully self-sustaining.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.952
A new home where the dinosaurs
will be secure and free.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.988
CLAIRE:
You're gonna get them out?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.456
You're gonna save them?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.258
LOCKWOOD:
No, Ms. Dearing.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.127
I'm going to save us.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.030
We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?

14:24.064 --> 14:26.032
Lovely to see you again.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.168
-And you, Mr. Lockwood.
-Hmm.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.705
This was all
John Hammond's dream,

14:31.738 --> 14:34.307
to let these creatures
live in peace.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.510
So we have created sanctuary.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.180
No fences, no cages,

14:40.213 --> 14:42.148
no tourists--

14:42.182 --> 14:44.517
just as Mother Nature intended.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.320
John said it best:

14:47.354 --> 14:50.523
"These creatures don't need
our protection.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.393
They need our absence."

14:56.196 --> 14:59.366
When we were young,
we both shared this passion,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.434
John and I.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.470
What fools we were.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.174
Trying to run
before we'd learned to walk.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.177
As all young men do, I suppose.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.081
But... we learned.

15:15.115 --> 15:19.085
Unfortunately, in the end,
it drove us apart.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.191
Life teaches us
some very hard lessons,

15:25.225 --> 15:27.127
doesn't it, Claire?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.430
Yes.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.499
-Sir Benjamin.
-Hmm?

15:32.532 --> 15:35.235
Ah. My bloody medicines.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.237
Will you excuse me, Claire?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.538
Of course.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.374
Eli here will help you
with the details.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.510
We will save them.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.381
What a gift...

15:48.415 --> 15:50.350
for our children.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.252
(softly):
Thank you.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.554
Iris.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.124
(Lockwood coughs)

15:59.459 --> 16:01.227
Does he have children?
I-I thought I saw...

16:01.261 --> 16:03.229
-Was there a little girl...
-Uh, he has a grandchild.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.332
He's, uh, his daughter died
in a car accident.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.268
-That's awful.
-Yeah, I know.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.237
But they're very close.
Really close.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.640
So what do you need from me?

16:13.673 --> 16:16.576
There was a tracking system
in place at your park--

16:16.609 --> 16:19.112
radio-frequency ID chips
in each dinosaur.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.613
-I remember.
-Right. So if we could access

16:20.647 --> 16:22.816
that system,
our ability to locate

16:22.849 --> 16:24.818
and capture
those animals safely

16:24.851 --> 16:26.386
would increase tenfold.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.621
We need your handprint
to access the system.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.125
But what I really need,
Claire...

16:32.158 --> 16:33.526
is you.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.262
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal,

16:36.296 --> 16:38.264
but it's the right thing to do.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.233
No one knows this park
as well as you do,

16:40.266 --> 16:42.235
and we need that expertise.

16:42.268 --> 16:45.071
-How many can you save?
-11 species, for sure.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.841
I mean, more if we can--
but time is against us.

16:47.874 --> 16:51.845
I'm afraid there is one animal
in particular

16:51.878 --> 16:55.281
that poses
a real challenge for us.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.417
-Blue.
-I didn't know she had a name,

16:57.450 --> 16:59.285
but Blue is potentially

16:59.319 --> 17:01.554
the second most intelligent
piece of life on this planet,

17:01.588 --> 17:04.290
and she's the last of her kind.
She must be preserved.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.326
She can pick up your scent
a mile off--

17:06.359 --> 17:07.460
you'll never capture her.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.462
Well...

17:09.496 --> 17:12.499
we thought you might know
someone who could help.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.602
Maybe you could convince him.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.473
* *

17:32.452 --> 17:34.087
(exhales)

17:36.389 --> 17:37.724
OWEN:
* Oh, Time *

17:37.757 --> 17:41.695
* She is a freight train
chugging *

17:41.728 --> 17:44.297
(singing indistinctly)

17:46.733 --> 17:49.502
* The light
at the end of the tunnel *

17:51.771 --> 17:54.341
* Is growing small *

17:54.374 --> 17:55.542
* Behind you *

17:55.575 --> 17:57.177
Hey, Owen.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.746
* I still love you *

17:59.779 --> 18:01.348
* In the morning. *

18:01.381 --> 18:02.449
Owen!

18:03.516 --> 18:05.285
Oh, boy.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.626
Hi.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.596
Back for more, huh?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.565
Can I buy you a beer?

18:18.598 --> 18:22.635
Did you bring 'em, or do we
gotta, like, go somewhere?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.671
(Claire laughing loudly)

18:24.704 --> 18:28.708
(Creedence Clearwater Revival's
"Don't Look Now" playing)

18:28.742 --> 18:31.778
(laughing):
I'm sorry. Seriously?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.381
I can't believe you think
that you left me.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.949
Replay the conversation
in your head, all right?

18:35.982 --> 18:38.585
You said, "You wanna go live
in your van like a bum?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.587
Go ahead, Owen."

18:40.620 --> 18:42.589
And I said, "Okay."

18:42.622 --> 18:46.259
-So how is that you leaving me?
-Because I left. I left you.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.962
You left because I told you to.

18:48.995 --> 18:52.432
And then I left. Because you
didn't wanna live in a van

18:52.465 --> 18:54.668
-on the side of the road,
remember? -No. No, no, no, no.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.970
Because you wouldn't let me
drive the damn van

18:57.003 --> 18:58.471
-for five minutes.
-I'm chivalrous.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.674
-What can I do?
-You are so stubborn.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.542
Well, look at you now.
You're saving the world, so...

19:02.575 --> 19:04.544
Well, I'm trying at least.
You can't just run away

19:04.577 --> 19:06.212
from everything, Owen.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.547
So you're what...

19:07.580 --> 19:09.282
dating an accountant now?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.418
An insurance actuary?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.553
Your skin looks nice.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.555
("Don't Look Now" continues)

19:15.588 --> 19:18.425
-Dermatologist?
-Owen...

19:18.458 --> 19:20.360
-Does he check you for moles?
-Stop.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.329
-Ventriloquist? -This
is not why we're here, okay?

19:23.363 --> 19:25.298
Yeah, I know why we're here.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.300
Lockwood's little flunky
called me.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.269
Rescue Op.
Save the dinosaurs

19:29.302 --> 19:32.572
from an island that's about to
explode-- what could go wrong?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.541
-I'm going.
-Don't.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.344
-I don't have a choice. -What?
Of course you have a choice.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.480
So what, I should just...
build my own cabin, play pool,

19:40.513 --> 19:42.549
and drink beer all day while
these dinosaurs go extinct?

19:42.582 --> 19:43.783
Yeah.

19:43.817 --> 19:45.518
I like pool.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.654
Blue is alive.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.690
Jesus, Claire.

19:50.724 --> 19:52.826
You raised her, Owen.
You... you spent years

19:52.859 --> 19:54.828
of your life working with her.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.430
You're just gonna let her die?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.600
Well, yeah.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.470
("Don't Look Now" ends)

20:03.503 --> 20:07.273
Come on, you're a better man
than... you think you are.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.244
You should write
fortune cookies.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.680
Forget it, I...

20:13.713 --> 20:16.883
There's a charter flight
leaving tomorrow morning.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.351
You're on the manifest.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.753
I just wanted to let you know.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.628
* *

20:28.661 --> 20:31.264
(insects chittering, chirping)

20:34.801 --> 20:37.437
-(velociraptors squawking)
-OWEN: <i>All right, chow time,</i>

20:37.470 --> 20:38.738
<i>chow time.</i>

20:38.772 --> 20:40.340
<i>Whoa, whoa.</i>

20:40.373 --> 20:41.708
Back up. Back off.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.344
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Geesh!

20:44.377 --> 20:46.880
-(squawking)
-Take it easy. Echo.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.382
Geez. There's plenty of food.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.551
God, you guys been eating
sugar or something?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.520
You're hyper today.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.721
(velociraptors
chomping quietly)

20:54.754 --> 20:56.456
Okay, okay.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.925
-(chattering, hissing)
-Back up. Thank you, Blue.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.694
(screeching)

21:01.928 --> 21:03.563
Whoa, whoa.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.831
(chattering)

21:07.701 --> 21:09.669
Did you get that?

21:09.703 --> 21:11.671
* *

21:13.540 --> 21:15.308
(squawks)

21:16.576 --> 21:17.844
(squawks)

21:17.877 --> 21:20.714
ZIA: Relax.
You're more likely to die

21:20.747 --> 21:22.549
riding on a horse
than in a plane.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.551
No, I'm not,
'cause I won't get on a horse.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.920
-My chances are zero. -Planes
are the safest way to travel.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.755
FRANKLIN: You call this
a plane? My cousin has

21:28.788 --> 21:30.757
a drone bigger than this.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.359
* *

21:32.392 --> 21:34.594
(indistinct chatter
in distance)

21:37.397 --> 21:39.532
-(groans softly)
-Owen!

21:39.566 --> 21:40.800
Franklin, you wiener,
get on the plane.

21:40.834 --> 21:43.403
Didn't think you
were gonna ever show up.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.872
Oh, um, this is Zia Rodriguez.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.508
-Zia.
-Hey. How you doing?

21:48.541 --> 21:49.709
-Yeah. Real good. How are you?
-Good.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.345
Franklin Webb.
Systems analyst.

21:53.847 --> 21:56.383
-Nervous flyer?
-Would you ride

21:56.416 --> 21:58.551
a thousand-pound horse that's
been abused all its life?

21:58.585 --> 21:59.886
I rode my motorcycle
through the jungle

21:59.919 --> 22:01.921
with a pack of raptors.

22:01.955 --> 22:04.491
We're not compatible.

22:16.970 --> 22:19.739
IRIS (calls):
<i>Maisie?</i>

22:19.773 --> 22:21.608
(quietly):
You're always hiding from me.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.710
This is not my job,
looking for you.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.546
Maisie!

22:26.579 --> 22:28.581
(sighs)

22:28.615 --> 22:31.451
Maisie?

22:32.652 --> 22:34.521
Come out!

22:38.792 --> 22:39.893
(rustling)

22:47.701 --> 22:50.637
-Boo! (laughing)
-Oh! You silly sausage.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.505
You'll be the death of me.
You know, one day

22:52.539 --> 22:53.773
my heart might really stop.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.041
Then what would you do?

22:55.075 --> 22:56.843
Go and live in the forest
with the lions?

22:56.876 --> 22:58.511
There are no lions
in the forest.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.046
Your grandfather's
been asking for you.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.749
-Really? -Mm-hmm. So you go
see your grandfather, and then

23:02.782 --> 23:04.651
-you go straight to your bath.
-I don't want a bath.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.520
A what?! Queen's English,
girl. "Bath"!

23:07.554 --> 23:08.888
-Bath. Bath.
-Bath.

23:08.922 --> 23:11.057
Bath, not "bath."
You're not a wild animal.

23:11.091 --> 23:13.526
-(roars, laughs)
-(yells) Stop it.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.462
(Maisie's laughter continues)

23:16.696 --> 23:18.231
-(knocking)
-(door opens)

23:18.264 --> 23:21.534
-Hi, Grandpa.
-Ah, there you are.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.069
Come over and sit by me.

23:23.103 --> 23:25.805
-I've missed you.
-I was on safari all the way

23:25.839 --> 23:27.974
through the Cretaceous
to the Jurassic in one day.

23:28.008 --> 23:31.011
-Oh, my. What'd you see?
-Mostly herbivores.

23:31.044 --> 23:32.846
There was one T. rex, though.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.681
Casualties, of course.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.649
Iris included.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.818
-She jumped out of her skin.
-(Lockwood chuckles)

23:38.852 --> 23:40.854
You have your mother's
wicked sense of humor.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.890
* *

23:43.923 --> 23:45.592
Do I look like her?

23:47.727 --> 23:48.895
Oh, yes.

23:49.996 --> 23:53.833
You could be her mirror image.

23:53.867 --> 23:56.002
Did my mother
ever visit the park?

23:56.036 --> 23:58.638
(chuckles softly)
Once...

23:58.672 --> 24:00.807
a long time ago.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.576
She would have saved them,
too, you know.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.279
<i> She would have saved them all.</i>

24:06.312 --> 24:08.481
* *

24:30.737 --> 24:32.939
(animals squawking)

24:42.182 --> 24:44.617
(rumbling)

24:52.625 --> 24:55.595
* *

24:58.698 --> 25:01.768
(indistinct chatter)

25:03.203 --> 25:05.005
WHEATLEY:
Claire.

25:08.742 --> 25:10.810
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.345
Quite an operation
you've got going on here.

25:12.379 --> 25:14.681
Mr. Lockwood takes
his humanitarian efforts

25:14.714 --> 25:15.949
very seriously.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.651
Where's the, uh,
raptor wrangler?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.653
Animal behaviorist.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.623
-Owen Grady.
-Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.792
And you are...
Great White Hunter?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.060
(chuckles):
I guess.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.130
I'm the expedition facilitator.

25:30.163 --> 25:31.664
FRANKLIN:
Oh, God!

25:31.698 --> 25:33.600
It's hot!

25:33.633 --> 25:35.969
It's about to get
a whole lot hotter.

25:37.137 --> 25:39.105
* *

25:41.107 --> 25:43.977
Keep it moving!
You're all clear!

25:44.010 --> 25:47.080
Go! Go, you've got
the green light!

25:47.113 --> 25:49.149
This way, let's go!

25:49.182 --> 25:52.085
Let's go! Keep it moving!

25:52.118 --> 25:54.754
Hold it! Hold up!

25:54.788 --> 25:56.790
(rhythmic buzzing)

25:59.993 --> 26:01.895
(soldier shouting in distance)

26:03.863 --> 26:05.832
Need some bug spray?

26:05.865 --> 26:09.736
Bug spray?

26:09.769 --> 26:11.671
The T. rex would be dead
by now, right?

26:11.705 --> 26:14.040
ZIA: No. It's impossible
to know the max lifespan

26:14.074 --> 26:16.109
of a clone in a completely
different environment.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.212
Take a caveman that would
have lived 20 years, feed him

26:19.245 --> 26:21.047
prime meals,
give him health care,

26:21.081 --> 26:22.982
he's gonna live...
five times as long.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.821
So she'd be dead by now.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.989
Right?

26:30.023 --> 26:32.959
(rhythmic buzzing)

26:39.132 --> 26:41.067
* *

27:02.188 --> 27:04.157
* *

27:14.501 --> 27:16.670
WHEATLEY:
Bad memories?

27:18.805 --> 27:21.107
Some were good.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.314
(thundering boom in distance)

27:28.348 --> 27:30.784
(engine turns off)

27:30.817 --> 27:32.986
What was that?

27:34.921 --> 27:37.957
(thundering boom in distance)

27:39.859 --> 27:41.828
Is it the T. rex?

27:46.266 --> 27:49.002
(thundering booming,
debris clattering)

27:49.035 --> 27:51.338
I have to see this.

27:51.371 --> 27:53.907
Hey. Miss?

27:53.940 --> 27:55.275
Miss!

27:55.308 --> 27:57.243
This area's not secured.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.313
(thundering boom)

28:04.984 --> 28:06.853
(thundering boom)

28:06.886 --> 28:09.255
(bellowing)

28:09.289 --> 28:11.925
(dinosaur growling)

28:14.160 --> 28:16.863
(thundering steps)

28:19.866 --> 28:21.234
(bellowing)

28:25.271 --> 28:28.375
(crunching)

28:28.408 --> 28:30.343
ZIA:
Look at that.

28:30.377 --> 28:33.313
Never thought I'd see one
in real life.

28:34.414 --> 28:36.349
She's beautiful.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.321
(bellowing)

28:48.328 --> 28:50.563
Can we...?

28:50.597 --> 28:52.766
* *

29:03.309 --> 29:05.278
Okay, let's go.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.849
(grunts)

29:09.883 --> 29:11.151
Okay, okay.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.586
Okay, main system.

29:13.620 --> 29:16.022
-Turn on control.
-(low rumbling)

29:16.056 --> 29:18.925
-It should be working.
-(rumbling growing louder)

29:20.860 --> 29:23.797
-(booming)
-(animals squawking)

29:26.066 --> 29:27.334
WHEATLEY:
Come on, tiger.

29:27.367 --> 29:29.235
-You know what you're doing?
-(beeping)

29:34.107 --> 29:36.042
After you, tiger.

29:38.311 --> 29:40.046
ZIA: Are we sure
these biometric chips

29:40.080 --> 29:41.114
are still transmitting?

29:41.147 --> 29:42.916
Battery would be dead by now.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.151
-All right. -CLAIRE:
The dinosaur is the battery.

29:45.185 --> 29:47.153
They're powered
by body heat and movement.

29:47.187 --> 29:48.355
-(snaps fingers)
-Hand.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.027
CLAIRE:
How much longer until...

29:54.060 --> 29:56.329
(thumping, whirring)

29:56.363 --> 29:58.198
FRANKLIN:
I'm in.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.101
(low beeping)

30:01.134 --> 30:03.470
FRANKLIN: There's a large
concentration on the east dock.

30:03.503 --> 30:06.006
That's our boat-- we've already
captured a bunch of 'em.

30:06.039 --> 30:09.109
-Without the tracking system?
-The big herbivores

30:09.142 --> 30:10.210
are easy to find.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.878
Can you isolate that raptor?

30:11.911 --> 30:13.113
-I need a species code.
-D-nine.

30:17.484 --> 30:20.987
There she is. I'm gonna need
to borrow your truck.

30:21.021 --> 30:22.288
I'm coming with you--
we don't know

30:22.322 --> 30:24.024
what kind of condition
she might be in.

30:24.057 --> 30:26.893
Miss, things could get hairy
out there.

30:28.495 --> 30:30.897
These are powerful sedatives.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.166
One too many, and she
could have respiratory failure.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.168
Also, I'm not
as soft and witless

30:35.201 --> 30:37.504
as your comment implies.

30:37.537 --> 30:39.906
Let's go, beefcake.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.141
Oh, Owen?

30:43.476 --> 30:45.912
Be careful, okay?

30:47.080 --> 30:48.982
* *

30:49.015 --> 30:51.017
If I don't make it back...

30:51.051 --> 30:53.319
remember...

30:53.353 --> 30:55.889
you're the one
who made me come.

30:57.290 --> 31:00.026
-I'll be all right.
-(cocks gun)

31:01.561 --> 31:04.964
-(distant rumbling)
-(excited squawking)

31:09.536 --> 31:12.372
We're not gonna get any closer
to her in this thing.

31:12.405 --> 31:15.375
-We should stop here.
-Hold up!

31:17.477 --> 31:20.313
Load out, look alive,
stay alive.

31:20.347 --> 31:23.116
-We got your back, brother.
-Yeah.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.318
OWEN (over radio): Claire, I'm
gonna have to track her alone.

31:25.352 --> 31:28.054
I'll need you to be my eyes
if she runs. Copy?

31:28.088 --> 31:29.289
Copy that.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.491
(rhythmic beeping)

31:37.297 --> 31:39.099
(distant thunder rolling)

31:40.200 --> 31:42.402
(screeching in distance)

31:45.205 --> 31:46.473
(screeching)

31:46.506 --> 31:49.476
(squawking)

31:58.551 --> 32:00.754
(squawking fades in distance)

32:00.787 --> 32:03.023
(distant booming)

32:04.190 --> 32:06.126
Wheatley, I'm on fresh sign.

32:06.159 --> 32:07.994
Wait for my signal.

32:08.028 --> 32:09.329
(distant rumbling)

32:20.173 --> 32:21.541
(distant rumbling)

32:30.150 --> 32:33.453
(distant rumbling)

32:33.486 --> 32:35.321
There you are.

32:41.528 --> 32:43.129
(screeching)

32:44.564 --> 32:46.399
(screeching)

32:48.068 --> 32:51.404
-(hissing)
-Hey, girl. You miss me?

32:53.406 --> 32:55.342
-(squawks)
-Easy. Hey!

32:55.375 --> 32:57.344
-(hisses)
-Hey.

32:57.377 --> 33:01.448
-(chitters)
-I brought you something.

33:01.481 --> 33:03.283
(bellows)

33:04.451 --> 33:07.120
-(hissing)
-Here you go.

33:08.188 --> 33:09.522
That's right.

33:10.457 --> 33:11.524
(low growling)

33:11.558 --> 33:13.827
Okay.

33:13.860 --> 33:15.495
-(screeches)
-Hey.

33:15.528 --> 33:17.564
(huffs, hisses)

33:17.597 --> 33:19.632
(grunts, growls)

33:19.666 --> 33:22.335
You know me.

33:22.369 --> 33:24.404
Eyes on me.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.373
-(grunts, huffs)
-Yeah.

33:26.406 --> 33:29.142
-(low growling)
-Yeah.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.610
(whispers):
Yeah.

33:30.643 --> 33:33.413
You know me.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.415
That's right.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.384
-(sniffing)
-That's right.

33:39.586 --> 33:40.854
Hold your...
(grunts)

33:40.887 --> 33:43.223
(screeching)

33:43.256 --> 33:44.357
I told you to wait
for my signal!

33:44.391 --> 33:46.526
(guns cocking)

33:46.559 --> 33:49.162
(growling, screeching)

33:49.195 --> 33:52.132
(quietly):
Back your men up right now.

33:52.165 --> 33:54.234
(low growling)

33:56.436 --> 33:58.371
(screeches)

33:58.405 --> 34:00.407
(grunting, yelling)

34:01.474 --> 34:02.542
(snarls)

34:02.575 --> 34:04.577
No, hey, no, no,
don't shoot her!

34:05.612 --> 34:07.113
-(screams)
-(gunshot)

34:07.147 --> 34:08.348
(screeches)

34:11.151 --> 34:15.088
(seething exhale)
Wheatley, you son of a bitch!

34:21.428 --> 34:23.096
(exhales sharply)

34:24.264 --> 34:26.266
Owen! What are you doing?!

34:26.299 --> 34:27.667
Owen.

34:29.602 --> 34:31.104
(Blue bellowing weakly)

34:36.609 --> 34:38.345
You shoot me...

34:38.378 --> 34:40.246
and that animal dies.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.482
I think we have the drop
on you, sweetheart.

34:42.515 --> 34:45.618
She's losing blood,
and if I don't treat her...

34:45.652 --> 34:48.221
she'll never make it
back to camp.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.494
(exhales)

34:57.430 --> 34:58.698
How about this?

34:58.732 --> 35:01.501
That animal dies, I shoot you.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.503
You're gonna take care of her.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.238
Let's move out!

35:05.271 --> 35:08.375

35:16.282 --> 35:17.650
(both scream)

35:17.684 --> 35:20.186
MAN (in distance):
Cut the cord and let's go!

35:20.220 --> 35:21.721
Let's get out of here!

35:21.755 --> 35:23.423

(beeping)

35:25.492 --> 35:26.659

35:26.693 --> 35:27.761
No! No! No!

35:27.794 --> 35:29.396
No, wait!

35:29.429 --> 35:32.198
(Claire grunting)

35:32.232 --> 35:34.701
Wait, a-are they protecting us?
What's going on?

35:35.769 --> 35:36.803
(beep)

35:36.836 --> 35:38.271
I don't think so.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.572
(booming)

35:39.606 --> 35:40.774
(Franklin yells)

35:40.807 --> 35:42.442
Why am I here?!

35:46.613 --> 35:48.415
WHEATLEY:
<i>Hey, Mills, we got her done!</i>

35:48.448 --> 35:50.684
<i>Mission accomplished!</i>

35:52.452 --> 35:54.688
(laughs)
Just in the nick of time.

35:54.721 --> 35:56.423
Wheatley, what the hell
is going on there?

35:56.456 --> 35:57.691
We're a day
behind schedule already.

35:57.724 --> 35:59.392
WHEATLEY:
I want that money in the bank

35:59.426 --> 36:01.327
-by the time I get back,
all right? -Okay, good.

36:01.361 --> 36:02.729
Listen to me,
no more delays, okay?

36:02.762 --> 36:04.531
-Mr. Mills? -If we don't get
those animal...

36:04.564 --> 36:06.533
Not now, Maisie, thank you.
If we don't get those...

36:06.566 --> 36:09.502
-Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs
safe... -I said not now!

36:11.371 --> 36:13.340
WHEATLEY:
Mills?! Mills?!

36:13.373 --> 36:15.642
I'm sorry, honey.
This is an important call.

36:15.675 --> 36:17.444
If you go up to the library,

36:17.477 --> 36:19.713
-I'll meet you up there
in a few minutes. -Okay.

36:19.746 --> 36:21.448
Okay, I'll tell you
all about it, I promise.

36:21.481 --> 36:23.817
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.452
Wheatley...

36:25.485 --> 36:29.322
you get those animals here now.

36:29.356 --> 36:30.690
I want that bonus.
We got the blue one.

36:30.724 --> 36:33.460
-(low groaning)
-MILLS: Bring her to me first!

36:33.493 --> 36:35.628
WHEATLEY:
<i>All right.</i>

Hello? Can anyone hear me?

38:12.158 --> 38:13.693
-Hello?
-(computer beeping)

38:13.727 --> 38:15.362
Hello? Is anybody there?

38:15.395 --> 38:16.896
Can anybody copy?

38:16.930 --> 38:17.931
(grunts)

38:17.964 --> 38:19.833
I'm-I'm trying everything.

38:19.866 --> 38:21.534
It's jammed.

38:21.568 --> 38:23.470
"Just take the job, son,
build your people skills."

38:23.503 --> 38:25.372
-Yeah, thanks, Dad.
-(computer chiming)

38:25.405 --> 38:26.940
That's it.

38:26.973 --> 38:29.409
-(doors clank)
-(alarm chirping)

38:29.442 --> 38:30.910
Proximity alert.

38:32.946 --> 38:35.849
-Something's coming.
-Where does that tunnel lead?

38:35.882 --> 38:37.817
Well, it connects
to the rest of the...

38:37.851 --> 38:41.454
-(deep growl in distance)
-...park.

38:41.488 --> 38:43.423
(alarm continues chirping)

38:44.858 --> 38:46.459
FRANKLIN: It's the T. rex.
It's the T. rex.

38:46.493 --> 38:47.627
It's the T. rex.
Claire, it's the T. rex.

38:47.660 --> 38:48.695
It's the T. rex.
It's the T. rex.

38:48.728 --> 38:51.798
Will you stop?
It's not the T. rex.

38:51.831 --> 38:54.801
-Probably.
-"Probably"?

38:54.834 --> 38:56.503
(gasps)

38:56.536 --> 38:57.971
Lava! Lava!

38:58.004 --> 38:59.973
-(deep growling)
-Lava. Lava.

39:00.006 --> 39:02.175
Deep breaths, Franklin.

39:02.208 --> 39:03.877
-(roaring)
-(Claire gasps)

(high-pitched screaming)

39:18.058 --> 39:21.428

-How is this better?!

Claire, what do we do?!
What do we do?!

39:35.475 --> 39:37.043
(grunting)

39:37.077 --> 39:38.845
It's stuck!

39:38.878 --> 39:40.413
Chair!

39:42.916 --> 39:43.917
(gasping)

39:53.927 --> 39:55.862
(deep growling)

39:55.895 --> 39:57.864
Come on! Let's go!

39:57.897 --> 40:00.467
Come on, Franklin!

40:01.801 --> 40:04.871
-We made it! Yeah!

come on, come on!

-Come on, come on, come on!
-(roaring)

40:27.927 --> 40:29.062
(both screaming)

40:30.530 --> 40:32.932
Yes, yes, go, go! Go, go!

40:42.776 --> 40:44.778
-(gasping)
-(deep rumbling)

40:44.811 --> 40:47.580
Claire.

40:47.614 --> 40:48.815
Holy sh...

40:59.959 --> 41:01.928
OWEN (in distance):
Run!

41:03.630 --> 41:05.031
Run!

41:06.700 --> 41:08.802
-Run!
-(dinosaurs chirping)

OWEN:
Run!

Go, go!

42:21.941 --> 42:24.077
-Okay, okay. Okay.
-Buckle up, Franklin.

42:24.110 --> 42:26.146
Get in!

Owen!

44:09.849 --> 44:11.818
(bellowing,

44:40.180 --> 44:42.882
-CLAIRE: We got to get out.
-We just fell from the cliff.

44:42.916 --> 44:45.518
We're alive. We're alive.

44:45.552 --> 44:47.520
Franklin, move.

44:47.554 --> 44:51.157
-No. No, no, no!
-(water hissing)

44:51.191 --> 44:55.128
No. Claire, we're gonna sink!
Water's leaking!

44:55.161 --> 44:57.163
-Oh. Oh, God!
-(lava thumping on glass)

44:57.197 --> 44:59.966
We need to get out!

45:00.000 --> 45:01.534

45:01.568 --> 45:03.737
Franklin, watch out!

45:05.872 --> 45:07.974
(screams)
I want to go home!

45:08.008 --> 45:09.976
(both grunting)

45:11.845 --> 45:14.948
-Owen! Owen!
-Owen?

45:14.981 --> 45:16.783
Owen. Okay.

45:17.984 --> 45:19.786
Move! Move!

45:24.024 --> 45:26.292
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

45:26.326 --> 45:27.293
Push!

45:27.327 --> 45:30.130
(grunting)

45:30.163 --> 45:32.132
Owen! No, no.

45:34.868 --> 45:36.136
FRANKLIN:
Where's he going?

45:36.169 --> 45:37.871
CLAIRE:
Okay. Okay, don't panic.

45:37.904 --> 45:39.973
-Don't panic.
-We're running out of air.

45:40.006 --> 45:42.375
-We're not gonna make it.
-We are. We are.

45:42.409 --> 45:44.110
Take a deep breath.
(gasps)

45:49.182 --> 45:51.351

46:46.973 --> 46:48.908
(coughing, gasping)

46:54.114 --> 46:56.216
-Where is Zia?
-It was a double-cross.

46:56.249 --> 46:58.018
They took her.
She must be with Blue.

46:58.051 --> 47:00.053
Hey, can you still track 'em?

47:02.122 --> 47:04.491
Not anymore.

47:04.524 --> 47:07.427
It was a lie.
It was a lie.

47:07.460 --> 47:10.063
Bastards! It was all a lie!

47:10.096 --> 47:12.399
(loud rumbling)

47:18.004 --> 47:19.939
(roaring)

47:23.943 --> 47:25.879
Not all of it.

47:28.314 --> 47:30.917
(roaring)

47:30.950 --> 47:32.886
(ship horn blowing)

47:35.288 --> 47:38.458
Move it! Move! Move!

47:38.491 --> 47:41.327
Anything of value,
I want on that boat!

47:41.361 --> 47:43.329
-How you doing?!
-MAN: The bolt won't give!

47:43.363 --> 47:47.100
Well, just button it up,
and we'll tow it on! Let's go!

47:47.133 --> 47:49.402
(roaring)

47:51.304 --> 47:53.273
-(bellowing)
-Come on, now.

47:55.342 --> 47:57.310
(snarling)

48:01.181 --> 48:03.149
(squawking)

48:07.120 --> 48:09.956
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

48:09.989 --> 48:11.958
Hang on! Wait up!

48:11.991 --> 48:14.994
Stop that truck! Stop it!

48:15.028 --> 48:16.996
(low grumbling)

48:17.030 --> 48:20.166
Hey, sweetheart.
Hello, hello.

48:26.072 --> 48:29.009
(bellowing)

48:29.042 --> 48:30.310
Beautiful.

48:30.343 --> 48:32.212
You're gonna feel that
when you wake up.

48:34.180 --> 48:35.749
ZIA:
Hey, put your weapon down!

48:35.782 --> 48:37.951
You got the barrel pointed
right at her head!

48:39.419 --> 48:40.520
-Hey, Wheatley!
-OWEN: They have Zia.

48:40.553 --> 48:42.188
They're loading out.

48:42.222 --> 48:45.191
If they already had the
dinosaurs, why do they need us?

48:45.225 --> 48:48.395
They needed the tracking system
to capture Blue.

48:48.428 --> 48:50.497
OWEN: There she is.
She don't look good.

48:50.530 --> 48:52.499
(rumbling)

48:54.534 --> 48:56.336
We need to get on that boat.

48:56.369 --> 48:58.204
The rock's good.
We're safe on the rock.

48:58.238 --> 49:00.273
It's the boat or the lava,
Franklin.

49:00.306 --> 49:02.142
All right, boat's good.
I'm all about the boat.

49:02.175 --> 49:04.344
(men shouting)

49:04.377 --> 49:06.780
Go, go, get on the boat!

49:06.813 --> 49:09.516
Get on the boat now! Go, go!

49:11.217 --> 49:12.619
Move it, move it!

49:12.652 --> 49:16.089
(lava whooshing, whistling)

49:16.122 --> 49:17.390
Get that truck!

49:22.429 --> 49:24.397
(ship horn blowing)

49:33.673 --> 49:35.542
Franklin!

49:35.575 --> 49:38.545
-Hey, get that truck going!
-Okay.

49:38.578 --> 49:40.580
-You okay?
-Am I dead?

49:40.613 --> 49:42.148
Not yet, kid.

49:44.551 --> 49:46.553
(engine starts)

49:48.455 --> 49:50.423
Come on!

49:54.260 --> 49:55.595
Come on!

49:55.628 --> 49:58.131
Give me your hand! Reach!

49:58.164 --> 49:59.499
Come on, reach!

50:03.269 --> 50:04.471
(gasps)

50:11.311 --> 50:12.379
Hold on!

50:18.885 --> 50:20.086
(yelling)

50:25.692 --> 50:27.227
(tires screech)

50:27.260 --> 50:29.329
(panting)

50:29.362 --> 50:32.465
-(indistinct chatter)
-(alarm buzzing, ringing)

50:39.539 --> 50:41.474
(dinosaur bellowing)

50:52.285 --> 50:54.220

50:56.623 --> 50:59.526

51:09.235 --> 51:12.238
-(bellowing continues)
-(trembling breath)

51:12.272 --> 51:14.240
(bellowing)

51:22.515 --> 51:24.451
(bellowing)

51:29.789 --> 51:32.359

51:38.732 --> 51:41.301

51:45.739 --> 51:48.375

51:48.408 --> 51:50.343

52:05.625 --> 52:07.560
(radar beeping steadily)

52:15.635 --> 52:18.538
-(intercom beeps)
-IRIS: Mr. Mills?

52:18.571 --> 52:20.507
Your visitor's waiting.

52:21.808 --> 52:23.677
(footsteps approaching)

52:23.710 --> 52:25.679
MILLS:
Mr. Eversoll.

52:25.712 --> 52:27.681
It's a pleasure
to meet you in person

52:27.714 --> 52:29.482
after all this time.
How are ya?

52:29.516 --> 52:30.550
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

52:30.583 --> 52:32.285
-Where are the dinosaurs?
-The dinosaurs are, uh,

52:32.318 --> 52:33.219
are en route.

52:33.253 --> 52:35.622
Oh, so am I supposed
to sell these ones?

52:35.655 --> 52:37.290
Look, you don't need
to worry, okay?

52:37.323 --> 52:38.358
They will be here soon.

52:38.391 --> 52:40.694
I-I don't really
work with amateurs,

52:40.727 --> 52:43.296
so I'm gonna contact my buyers
and call this off.

52:43.329 --> 52:44.564
They will be here tomorrow,

52:44.597 --> 52:46.299
and your buyers
won't be disappointed.

52:46.332 --> 52:47.267
Trust me,
whatever their interest--

52:47.300 --> 52:49.569
agricultural,
industrial, sport hunting--

52:49.602 --> 52:51.538
we will have something
to suit them.

52:51.571 --> 52:55.709
11 species, each with unique
biopharmaceutical properties.

52:55.742 --> 52:59.546
I estimate
four million per species.

52:59.579 --> 53:03.249
Four million is a slow Tuesday
where I'm from.

53:03.283 --> 53:04.784
You're wasting my time.

53:04.818 --> 53:06.586
You ever made a hundred million
on a Tuesday?

53:06.619 --> 53:09.456
-(laughs)
-Huh?

53:09.489 --> 53:11.725
All this is in the past.

53:11.758 --> 53:14.327
I want to talk to you
about the future.

53:14.361 --> 53:17.630
I'll give you ten minutes.

53:19.466 --> 53:22.335
The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs

53:22.369 --> 53:24.804
is to finance
our future operations here.

53:24.838 --> 53:27.307
It's, uh, seed money.

53:27.340 --> 53:30.377
Call it a-an overture to
something much more ambitious.

53:30.410 --> 53:32.879
EVERSOLL: Yeah,
and more lucrative, I guess.

53:32.912 --> 53:36.349
Right. We've reactivated
the old facilities,

53:36.383 --> 53:37.617
updated the technology,
and imported

53:37.650 --> 53:40.353
the best geneticists
from around the world.

53:40.387 --> 53:42.489
This operation has been
many years in the planning.

53:42.522 --> 53:44.758
Genetic power is
an uncharted frontier.

53:44.791 --> 53:48.728
<i>The potential for growth</i>
<i>is more than you can fathom.</i>

53:51.498 --> 53:52.699
This way, please.

53:52.732 --> 53:55.068
If the entire run
of our sorry history

53:55.101 --> 53:57.637
has taught us
one irrevocable lesson,

53:57.671 --> 54:00.707
it's that man is
inevitably drawn to war

54:00.740 --> 54:04.511
and is willing to use
any means necessary to win it.

54:04.544 --> 54:06.780
-You're gonna weaponize them?
-We've been using animals

54:06.813 --> 54:08.648
in combat for centuries.

54:08.682 --> 54:10.650
Horses, elephants.

54:10.684 --> 54:12.652
The Soviets used
disease-bearing rats

54:12.686 --> 54:15.355
-against the Germans
at Stalingrad. -Yes, yes.

54:15.388 --> 54:16.890
Our geneticists have created

54:16.923 --> 54:19.626
a direct descendant
of Henry Wu's masterpiece,

54:19.659 --> 54:21.828
the animal that took down
Jurassic World.

54:22.896 --> 54:24.798
<i>Indominus rex.</i>

54:24.831 --> 54:26.666
Her DNA,
retrieved from the island

54:26.700 --> 54:29.736
way before its destruction,
forms the architecture

54:29.769 --> 54:32.105
of a completely new creature.

54:32.138 --> 54:35.909
Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.

54:35.942 --> 54:38.411
And thanks
to Owen Grady's research,

54:38.445 --> 54:40.714
it follows human command.

54:40.747 --> 54:42.582
We call it...

54:42.615 --> 54:44.451
the <i>Indoraptor.</i>

54:46.553 --> 54:48.488
(door creaks quietly)

54:51.524 --> 54:53.793
-(whispers): Grandpa?
-(door creaks shut)

54:53.827 --> 54:55.328
Grandpa?

55:12.812 --> 55:13.780
-(snorts softly)
-(gasps)

55:13.813 --> 55:15.448
Grandpa.

55:15.482 --> 55:17.450
Maisie?
What are you doing up?

55:17.484 --> 55:20.854
There was a man here today
with Mr. Mills.

55:20.887 --> 55:22.555
It was probably
just some business

55:22.589 --> 55:23.857
about the sanctuary,
that's all.

55:23.890 --> 55:25.825
I heard them talking--
they're going

55:25.859 --> 55:26.860
to sell the dinosaurs.

55:26.893 --> 55:28.461
They're bringing them here.

55:28.495 --> 55:29.529
Well...

55:29.562 --> 55:31.498
I'm sure you misunderstood.

55:31.531 --> 55:33.533
-I know what I heard, Grandpa.
-Maisie,

55:33.566 --> 55:34.901
it's way past your bedtime.

55:34.934 --> 55:37.437
Let's talk about this
in the morning.

55:37.470 --> 55:40.473
-But... -Maisie,
I'll find out tomorrow.

55:40.507 --> 55:41.775
Go to bed.

55:43.009 --> 55:44.611
Good night.

55:44.644 --> 55:46.579
Good night, my heart.

55:46.613 --> 55:47.847
(door opens)

55:47.881 --> 55:49.582
(door closes)

55:51.051 --> 55:52.986
* *

55:56.956 --> 55:58.992
(rumbling, booming)

55:59.025 --> 56:01.628
(dinosaur bellowing)

56:01.661 --> 56:03.630
(squawking, chittering)

56:15.742 --> 56:17.644
-(growls)
-Oh! Jesus.

56:17.677 --> 56:19.212
(squeaky grunting)

56:19.245 --> 56:21.047
(rapid huffing)

56:21.081 --> 56:22.782
-(groans softly)
-(thumping)

56:22.816 --> 56:25.485
(squawking)

56:25.518 --> 56:27.954
It's okay, Blue.
Just a little longer.

56:27.987 --> 56:29.556
Oh, my God!
You guys are alive! You...

56:33.827 --> 56:35.595
Oh, look what
they've done to her.

56:35.628 --> 56:38.231
-Who are these assholes?
-Animal traffickers.

56:38.264 --> 56:39.966
Look how they're treating them.
They're not gonna take 'em

56:40.000 --> 56:41.601
to a sanctuary,
they're gonna sell them.

56:41.634 --> 56:43.636
Not Blue. They need her
for something else.

56:43.670 --> 56:45.939
-Like what?
-I don't know, but she's...

56:45.972 --> 56:47.941
she's hemorrhaging,
and I don't have instruments,

56:47.974 --> 56:49.676
and they want to keep her alive.

56:49.709 --> 56:51.678
-Hey. Shh...
-(Blue panting)

56:51.711 --> 56:53.079
-(cooing) -You're all right.
You're all right.

56:53.113 --> 56:54.547
ZIA:
Claire, come here.

56:54.581 --> 56:55.815
Come on.
Put your hand here.

56:55.849 --> 56:56.950
Steady pressure.

56:56.983 --> 56:58.685
-(screeches)
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

57:00.286 --> 57:01.654
Watch out.

57:01.688 --> 57:03.056
I can't take the bullet out

57:03.089 --> 57:04.824
without a transfusion
from another animal.

57:04.858 --> 57:07.494
-Which one of you knows
how to find a vein? -Oh.

57:07.527 --> 57:09.696
-I-I did a blood drive
for the Red Cross. -Great.

57:09.729 --> 57:13.099
Okay. Franklin,
take over for Claire.

57:13.133 --> 57:14.668
No, no, no, no, no, no...

57:14.701 --> 57:16.870
Franklin. Now.

57:18.605 --> 57:19.939
-Steady pressure.
-(bellowing)

57:19.973 --> 57:20.974
(gasps)

57:21.007 --> 57:23.510
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

57:23.543 --> 57:25.979
-Is it in my mouth?
Did it get in my mouth? -Mm-mm.

57:26.012 --> 57:27.547
-You sure?
-You're good.

57:27.580 --> 57:28.915
All of the animals
should be sedated.

57:28.948 --> 57:30.617
Look for any kind of tetanuran.

57:30.650 --> 57:32.786
Their blood type
should be close enough.

57:32.819 --> 57:35.055
Look for carnivores
with two or three fingers.

57:35.088 --> 57:37.691
No more than three.

57:37.724 --> 57:40.060
I think there's one on board.

57:45.131 --> 57:47.067
(slow, deep breathing)

57:51.671 --> 57:53.973
(insects buzzing)

57:54.007 --> 57:56.609
You got to be kidding me.

57:58.878 --> 58:00.580
(snorts)

58:02.349 --> 58:04.117
(gasps)

58:10.090 --> 58:12.659
(insects buzzing)

58:12.692 --> 58:14.694
She's tranqued.

58:19.065 --> 58:20.667
Okay, okay.

58:20.700 --> 58:21.801
Okay, I got it.

58:21.835 --> 58:22.802
Come on.

58:22.836 --> 58:25.105
Okay.
(sighs)

58:26.940 --> 58:29.609
-(Claire gasps)
-(metallic bang)

58:29.642 --> 58:31.778
-(Owen grunts)
-Are you okay?

58:31.811 --> 58:33.947
(strained):
I'm okay.

58:33.980 --> 58:35.915
Come on.

58:41.054 --> 58:41.855
You're gonna have to do it.

58:41.888 --> 58:44.057
I can't, I--
the skin is too thick.

58:44.090 --> 58:46.059
I have to use both my hands
to put pressure on the vein.

58:46.092 --> 58:47.093
You got to do it.

58:47.127 --> 58:48.928
I-I can't. I can't reach.

58:48.962 --> 58:51.131
You're gonna have to
climb up there.

58:51.164 --> 58:53.033
Oh, I'm not...
(scoffs)

58:53.066 --> 58:54.801
No, no.
I'm not gonna climb up there.

58:54.834 --> 58:56.603
You'll be okay.
It's like riding a bull.

58:56.636 --> 58:58.772
"Riding a bull"?
I didn't grow up in a rodeo

58:58.805 --> 59:00.373
-or wherever you came from.
-She's asleep now.

59:00.407 --> 59:02.809
I can't say that she's gonna
be asleep a minute from now,

59:02.842 --> 59:03.843
so get up.

59:03.877 --> 59:04.811
Okay, fine.

59:04.844 --> 59:06.212
Oh, my God, she stinks.

59:06.246 --> 59:07.380
Jesus.

59:07.414 --> 59:08.682
-(grunts)
-Gently. Gently!

59:08.715 --> 59:12.018
(growls)

59:17.957 --> 59:20.026
(chuckles)

59:20.060 --> 59:22.095
Good job.

59:22.128 --> 59:24.831
You're making this look
totally normal.

59:24.864 --> 59:26.166
(chuckles)

59:26.199 --> 59:29.102
You're gonna have to
jam it in there.

59:29.135 --> 59:30.203
It's really thick skin.

59:30.236 --> 59:32.138
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Ready?

59:32.172 --> 59:33.239
-Okay. One...
-One...

59:33.273 --> 59:34.741
-Two...
-Two...

59:34.774 --> 59:35.642
CLAIRE:
Stab!

59:35.675 --> 59:36.976
-(growls)
-Oh, shoot.

59:37.010 --> 59:38.211
-Hey!
-(gasps) Owen!

59:38.244 --> 59:41.748
(grunts)

59:41.781 --> 59:43.717
Oh...

59:43.750 --> 59:45.118
Oh.

59:46.720 --> 59:47.954
It's working.

59:47.987 --> 59:51.057
-(chuckles)
-(men laughing nearby)

59:51.091 --> 59:53.126
MAN:
The pee is silent.

59:53.159 --> 59:54.260
MAN 2:
That door is open.

59:54.294 --> 59:55.995
MAN 3:
I got it.

59:59.766 --> 01:00:01.768
(growls softly)

01:00:05.171 --> 01:00:09.142
(roars)

01:00:09.175 --> 01:00:10.176
OWEN:
Shit!

01:00:12.212 --> 01:00:14.981
(gasps)
The bars!

01:00:15.015 --> 01:00:16.282
The bars, Owen. Owen,

01:00:16.316 --> 01:00:18.118
I can get through there.
Come on.

01:00:18.151 --> 01:00:20.020
(grunts)

01:00:20.053 --> 01:00:21.721
(roaring)

01:00:25.058 --> 01:00:26.659
(grunts)

01:00:29.496 --> 01:00:31.297
(roars)

01:00:31.331 --> 01:00:33.700
Jump, Owen!

01:00:34.934 --> 01:00:36.269
(roars loudly)

01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:40.840
Owen, jump.

01:00:40.874 --> 01:00:42.208
-Now!
-(grunts)

01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:47.213
(both panting)

01:00:51.084 --> 01:00:52.986
Did you see that?

01:00:53.019 --> 01:00:54.921
(both panting)

01:00:54.954 --> 01:00:57.190
Please tell me
you got the blood.

01:00:57.223 --> 01:00:59.993
-(blood sloshing)
-(rumbling growl)

01:01:00.026 --> 01:01:01.795
* *

01:01:01.828 --> 01:01:03.763
(door opens)

01:01:13.373 --> 01:01:15.308
(beeping)

01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:18.745
(doors hiss)

01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:22.315
(beeps)

01:01:36.296 --> 01:01:38.264
* *

01:01:52.345 --> 01:01:54.280
* *

01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:02.989
* *

01:02:19.005 --> 01:02:20.874
(dinosaur chitters on video)

01:02:20.907 --> 01:02:22.042
OWEN (over speakers):
This is Delta.

01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:23.376
She's one of
the holdover theropods,

01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:25.011
one of the survivors
from the second group.

01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:27.280
Now, watch this.

01:02:27.313 --> 01:02:30.250
I show any sign of weakness
whatsoever...

01:02:31.317 --> 01:02:32.886
(mock whimpering)

01:02:32.919 --> 01:02:36.022
(shrieking)

01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:37.390
See that?

01:02:37.424 --> 01:02:39.225
Day 176.
Blue is showing

01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:41.261
unprecedented levels
of compliance.

01:02:41.294 --> 01:02:44.197
Here I am with Blue.

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:46.366
She's a theropod
from the new group.

01:02:46.399 --> 01:02:50.170
-(chitters)
-I show signs of weakness...

01:02:50.203 --> 01:02:54.407
(mock whimpering)

01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:57.811
(purring)

01:02:59.646 --> 01:03:02.315
(chitters)

01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:06.086
Hey.

01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:08.254
-I'm okay.
-(chitters)

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:09.923
(chuckles):
She...

01:03:09.956 --> 01:03:11.091
she's pretty extraordinary.

01:03:16.963 --> 01:03:18.164
(beeps)

01:03:22.335 --> 01:03:25.071
OWEN:
<i>Blue, displaying levels</i>

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:28.074
<i>of interest, concern,</i>

01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:31.444
<i>hyper-intelligence, uh,</i>
<i>cognitive bonding.</i>

01:03:31.478 --> 01:03:34.314
See that?

01:03:34.347 --> 01:03:35.415
She's tilting her head.

01:03:35.448 --> 01:03:36.950
She's craning forward. Sh...

01:03:36.983 --> 01:03:40.353
Increased eye movement--
she's curious.

01:03:40.387 --> 01:03:42.956
-She's showing empathy.
-(chitters)

01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:44.424
ZIA: Okay,
I'm gonna make an incision

01:03:44.457 --> 01:03:46.926
in her leg
to remove the bullet.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.928
(shrieks)

01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:53.933
It's a lot of muscle tissue.

01:03:57.937 --> 01:04:00.173
(exhales)

01:04:05.945 --> 01:04:08.081
-(chitters)
-(laughing)

01:04:08.114 --> 01:04:10.216
(shushes)

01:04:13.219 --> 01:04:15.155
(Zia breathing shallowly)

01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:27.000
She's gonna be okay.

01:04:27.033 --> 01:04:30.337
(crying)

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:32.539
(laughs)

01:04:32.572 --> 01:04:34.541
-(laughs softly)
-OWEN: <i>Blue is the key.</i>

01:04:34.574 --> 01:04:36.142
(chitters, sneezes)

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:37.277
Bless you.

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:41.047
You have Blue, you get
these raptors to do anything.

01:04:41.081 --> 01:04:43.049
-(door opens)
-MAN: You're sure she'll live?

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:44.150
MILLS: If it dies,
we have blood samples.

01:04:44.184 --> 01:04:45.952
MAN: No, no, no.
That's not good enough.

01:04:45.985 --> 01:04:47.520
The raptor is
a behavioral specimen.

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:49.022
We need her in good health.

01:04:49.055 --> 01:04:51.057
I didn't shoot the damn thing.

01:04:51.091 --> 01:04:53.293
What do you want me to do, huh?

01:04:53.326 --> 01:04:56.429
You don't have
the faintest comprehension

01:04:56.463 --> 01:04:58.264
of what I'm doing here.

01:04:58.298 --> 01:04:59.499
Do you understand

01:04:59.532 --> 01:05:02.202
the complexity of creating
an entirely new

01:05:02.235 --> 01:05:04.170
-life-form?
-Uh, no, but I understand

01:05:04.204 --> 01:05:06.106
the complexity
of paying for it, okay?!

01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:08.041
HENRY: All your money
will have been wasted

01:05:08.074 --> 01:05:09.976
if I don't get Blue here
in good health.

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:12.579
To get the next iteration
under control,

01:05:12.612 --> 01:05:14.514
it needs to form
a familial bond

01:05:14.547 --> 01:05:16.049
with a closely-related
genetic link.

01:05:16.082 --> 01:05:18.518
-English, Henry.
-It needs a mother!

01:05:18.551 --> 01:05:19.886
(gasps)

01:05:19.919 --> 01:05:24.457
Blue's DNA will be part of
the next <i>Indoraptor's</i>makeup.

01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:26.192
So it will be genetically coded

01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:30.196
to recognize her authority
and assume her traits.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.197
Empathy, obedience--

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:33.400
everything the prototype
you have now is missing.

01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:35.435
Okay, so how long
is this gonna take?

01:05:35.468 --> 01:05:37.003
(scoffs)
It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills.

01:05:37.037 --> 01:05:38.038
It's a marathon.

01:05:38.071 --> 01:05:39.272
A marathon sounds expensive.

01:05:39.305 --> 01:05:43.209
Besides, time is running out
and so is my patience, Henry.

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.377
HENRY:
You have to understand,

01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:45.545
this is all
uncharted territory.

01:05:45.578 --> 01:05:47.614
A wolf, genetically,

01:05:47.647 --> 01:05:50.116
is barely distinguishable
from a bulldog,

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:53.520
but within that gray area...

01:05:53.553 --> 01:05:55.789
is art.

01:05:55.822 --> 01:05:57.624
MILLS: (groans)
Spare me the poetry, Henry.

01:05:57.657 --> 01:05:59.793
Can you do it?
Can you do it?

01:05:59.826 --> 01:06:01.361
HENRY:
Yes, I can do it.

01:06:01.394 --> 01:06:03.596
MILLS:
Well, then do it.

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:05.432
HENRY:
Thank you.

01:06:05.465 --> 01:06:07.300
MILLS:
God, you're a pain in the ass.

01:06:13.306 --> 01:06:14.574
(roars)

01:06:14.607 --> 01:06:15.642
(screams)

01:06:15.675 --> 01:06:18.011
(roaring)

01:06:19.679 --> 01:06:21.481
-Hey! Hey!
-(whimpering)

01:06:21.514 --> 01:06:24.250
-Maisie!
-(growling)

01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:26.653
What is that?

01:06:26.686 --> 01:06:28.121
What is it?!

01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:31.391
(grunts)

01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:38.298
Keep her in there
and keep the door locked.

01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:39.599
You want to keep her locked in?

01:06:39.632 --> 01:06:41.267
That's exactly what I want.

01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:43.503
Sir Benjamin needs
to see you now.

01:06:46.573 --> 01:06:48.308
I believe it's important.

01:06:51.177 --> 01:06:53.146

Let's move it, boys.

01:07:25.412 --> 01:07:27.380
(shouting continues
indistinctly)

01:07:27.414 --> 01:07:28.715
We're here.

01:07:28.748 --> 01:07:29.649
Where?

01:07:29.683 --> 01:07:31.451
WHEATLEY:
Get in your truck and let's go.

01:07:31.484 --> 01:07:34.187
-Move, move.
-Move, move, move.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.189
You got a heartbeat?

01:07:36.222 --> 01:07:37.357
Yeah. Do you?

01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:38.892
I need blood samples.

01:07:38.925 --> 01:07:41.561
I'm not here to help you
reset the food chain, so...

01:07:41.594 --> 01:07:43.363
take your own damn samples.

01:07:45.165 --> 01:07:46.633
(sighs)

01:07:46.666 --> 01:07:48.535
What a nasty woman.

01:07:48.568 --> 01:07:50.470
Go, go, now, now. Go.

01:07:50.503 --> 01:07:53.540
MAN (over speaker): Attention,
all crew. Attention, all crew.

01:07:53.573 --> 01:07:57.243
Drivers, get to your vehicles.

01:07:57.277 --> 01:08:00.747
Hey! What the hell's going on?

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:04.551
-I was, um...
-I need an extra pair of hands.

01:08:04.584 --> 01:08:05.652
-He volunteered.
-You deck crew?

01:08:05.685 --> 01:08:06.653
Aye, aye.

01:08:06.686 --> 01:08:08.455
We're loading out.
Follow me.

01:08:08.488 --> 01:08:10.223
Uh, does that mean we're
leaving the ship right now?

01:08:10.256 --> 01:08:11.291
That is what
"loading out" means.

01:08:11.324 --> 01:08:12.525
Now get moving.
Come on, follow me.

01:08:12.559 --> 01:08:14.427
Come on, kid.

01:08:14.461 --> 01:08:15.628
-Shit.
-There's lots to do.

01:08:15.662 --> 01:08:17.163
-Get a move on, come on.
-CLAIRE: Oh, no.

01:08:17.197 --> 01:08:18.298
He's not gonna make it.

01:08:18.331 --> 01:08:20.333
-Move it! Come on, move!
-CLAIRE: We have to help him.

01:08:20.367 --> 01:08:21.735
Stay here. I'll get him.

01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:24.237

Where are they taking them?

We're about to find out.

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.682
Yes!

01:09:16.322 --> 01:09:18.458
This is Lockwood's estate.

01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:22.729
He must have
one big-ass garage.

LOCKWOOD:
<i>Did you really think</i>

01:10:09.476 --> 01:10:11.277
<i>you could get away with it?</i>

01:10:12.512 --> 01:10:14.047
In my own house.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.851
You entrusted me
to guide your fortune

01:10:17.884 --> 01:10:19.552
into the future.

01:10:19.586 --> 01:10:20.687
I have done that.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.622
Damn you!

01:10:25.658 --> 01:10:27.427
Pick up that phone.

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:31.364
I want you to call the police.

01:10:31.398 --> 01:10:33.767
It'll be easier if the story
comes from you.

01:10:35.869 --> 01:10:37.804
As you say, sir.

01:10:44.477 --> 01:10:47.781
You know, I've been thinking,
John Hammond was right.

01:10:47.814 --> 01:10:48.648
(phone beeps)

01:10:48.682 --> 01:10:53.586
It was an unholy thing
that you did.

01:10:56.656 --> 01:10:59.693
I'm not the only
guilty one here, am I, sir?

01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:10.437

01:11:17.977 --> 01:11:20.313
Hey.

01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:23.550
We hit that town,
we call the cavalry,

01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:24.684
shut this down.

01:11:24.718 --> 01:11:26.453

(exhales sharply)
Hello.

01:11:30.857 --> 01:11:33.827
You should have stayed
on the island.

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.961
Better odds.

01:11:34.994 --> 01:11:36.463
-(guns cocking)
-(gasps)

01:11:46.406 --> 01:11:48.608
MILLS:
Hi, Claire.

01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:51.711
I just wanted to come
and apologize.

01:11:51.745 --> 01:11:53.913
I didn't want to bring you
into any of this,

01:11:53.947 --> 01:11:55.982
but it was the only way that
we could get the raptor.

01:11:56.016 --> 01:11:58.752
-(Owen grunts)
-We needed it.

01:11:58.785 --> 01:12:00.720
-Come on.
-(Claire huffs)

01:12:00.754 --> 01:12:02.689
So, what?

01:12:02.722 --> 01:12:03.823
This is it?

01:12:03.857 --> 01:12:05.759
I mean, you're a smart guy.

01:12:05.792 --> 01:12:07.794
You could have
started a foundation,

01:12:07.827 --> 01:12:12.632
cured cancer,
but instead you... what?

01:12:12.665 --> 01:12:14.000
Sell endangered species?

01:12:14.034 --> 01:12:15.635
I saved these animals.

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:17.470
You betrayed a dying man
for money.

01:12:17.504 --> 01:12:19.673
Claire, I admire your idealism,

01:12:19.706 --> 01:12:21.675
but we both exploited
these animals.

01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:23.810
At least I have the integrity
to admit it.

01:12:23.843 --> 01:12:25.645
I never, ever did anything
remotely illegal.

01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:28.882
You authorized the creation
of the <i>Indominus rex.</i>

01:12:28.915 --> 01:12:32.886
You exploited a living thing
in a cage for money.

01:12:32.919 --> 01:12:34.020
How is that different?

01:12:34.054 --> 01:12:36.022
Huh? And you.

01:12:36.056 --> 01:12:37.957
The man who proved raptors
can follow orders.

01:12:37.991 --> 01:12:39.492
You never thought about

01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:41.628
the applications
of your research, Owen?

01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:44.531
How many millions a trained
predator might be worth?

01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:51.571
You two, you're the parents
of the new world.

01:12:52.872 --> 01:12:53.973

01:12:56.943 --> 01:12:58.545
I think I'll break it.

01:12:58.578 --> 01:12:59.846
Let him go.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.061
Say, how we gonna end this?

01:13:15.095 --> 01:13:17.664
Well, as far as everybody else
is concerned,

01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:19.699
they burned up on the island.

Ah, and these guys

01:14:17.624 --> 01:14:19.592
-Great.
-And the guy in the beard

01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:21.594
is a proxy for Gregor Adlrich,

01:14:21.628 --> 01:14:23.563
the Slovenian arms dealer.

MILLS: Well, what-what's
their interest?

01:14:30.937 --> 01:14:33.006
Strictly personal.

01:14:33.039 --> 01:14:36.142
His kid wants
a baby triceratops.

01:14:36.176 --> 01:14:38.144
Glenn, how's Janet?

Grandpa.

Grandpa, wake up.

It's over.

01:16:04.798 --> 01:16:06.733
What a tragedy.

01:16:11.137 --> 01:16:13.139
I suppose now he's gone,

01:16:13.173 --> 01:16:15.241
you'll be looking
for another situation.

01:16:15.275 --> 01:16:17.177
No.

Maisie needs me.

I'm her guardian now.

What she needs is
no longer your concern.

You don't understand her

the way I do.

I understand her value.

01:16:36.029 --> 01:16:37.997
But I raised her.

-both of them.
-(gasps softly)

01:16:44.304 --> 01:16:47.774
-Please, Mr. Mills...
-Good-bye, Iris.

01:16:47.807 --> 01:16:51.044
* *

01:16:59.185 --> 01:17:02.188
(muffled creaking, squeaking)

01:17:05.892 --> 01:17:08.828
(creaking, squeaking continues)

01:17:19.005 --> 01:17:21.908
(bellowing in distance)

01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:24.177
(groaning, low grunting)

01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:29.115
CLAIRE:
Do you remember the first time

01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:31.718
you saw a dinosaur?

01:17:33.353 --> 01:17:36.022
First time you see them,
it's like...

01:17:36.056 --> 01:17:38.024
a miracle.

01:17:38.058 --> 01:17:41.127
You read about them in books,
you see the bones in museums,

01:17:41.161 --> 01:17:43.163
but you don't
really believe it.

01:17:43.196 --> 01:17:44.998
They're like myths.

01:17:46.366 --> 01:17:48.268
And then you see...

01:17:48.301 --> 01:17:50.970
the first one alive.

01:17:51.004 --> 01:17:54.174
(low, squeaky grunts)

01:17:54.207 --> 01:17:56.743
(deep exhale)

01:17:56.776 --> 01:17:58.244
This is not your fault.

01:17:58.278 --> 01:18:00.213
But it is.

01:18:00.246 --> 01:18:02.849
No.

01:18:02.882 --> 01:18:05.118
This one's on me.

01:18:06.986 --> 01:18:09.322
I showed 'em the way.

01:18:10.857 --> 01:18:13.793
Well, listen, you and I

01:18:13.827 --> 01:18:15.161
are gonna have plenty of time

01:18:15.195 --> 01:18:17.263
-to talk about this later.
-If there is a later.

01:18:17.297 --> 01:18:19.232
Yes, there is.

01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:21.001
(bellow in distance)

01:18:21.034 --> 01:18:23.103
I got a cabin to finish.

01:18:24.804 --> 01:18:25.839
(loud thump)

01:18:25.872 --> 01:18:29.142
(grunting, snorting nearby)

01:18:30.977 --> 01:18:32.879
CLAIRE:
What is that?

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.350
(grunting)

01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:40.086
Well, look who just woke up.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.122
(whistles)

01:18:42.155 --> 01:18:43.390
Boo.

01:18:43.423 --> 01:18:45.325
(snarling, screeching)

01:18:45.358 --> 01:18:47.894
(dinosaur groans)

01:18:49.262 --> 01:18:51.898
We're getting out of here.

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:55.802
Welcome...

01:18:55.835 --> 01:18:58.004
ladies, gentlemen,

01:18:58.038 --> 01:19:01.074
to this extraordinary evening.

01:19:01.107 --> 01:19:03.943
Let's dive right in

01:19:03.977 --> 01:19:05.879
with lot number one...

01:19:05.912 --> 01:19:08.181
the ankylosaurus.

01:19:08.214 --> 01:19:09.282
(amazed gasps)

01:19:09.315 --> 01:19:10.984
(growling)

01:19:11.017 --> 01:19:12.952
-(bellow)
-She's a herbivorous quadruped,

01:19:12.986 --> 01:19:15.588
-MAN: I'll be damned!
-late Cretaceous.

01:19:15.622 --> 01:19:19.359
This is one of
the largest armored dinosaurs,

01:19:19.392 --> 01:19:21.428
known by paleontologists

01:19:21.461 --> 01:19:24.130
-(bellows)
-as a living tank.

01:19:24.164 --> 01:19:26.099
-(shocked murmuring)
-(growling)

01:19:27.434 --> 01:19:28.401
-(whistles)
-(pounding steps)

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:29.402
(loud thump)

01:19:29.436 --> 01:19:31.338
What are you doing?

01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:33.106
Escaping.

01:19:33.139 --> 01:19:36.042
-You sure about this?
-Nope. (whistles)

01:19:36.076 --> 01:19:37.911
-(growling)
-(loud thump)

01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:40.080
I have $4 million.
Anyone with five?

01:19:40.113 --> 01:19:42.849
-MAN: $5 million.
-$5 million.

01:19:42.882 --> 01:19:44.217
$5 million.
Do I hear six?

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.119
-MAN: $6 million!
-$6 million. Thank you.

01:19:46.152 --> 01:19:47.320
Any increase on six... Seven.

01:19:47.354 --> 01:19:48.922
-$7 million.
-$8 million, now!

01:19:48.955 --> 01:19:50.857
$8 million.
$9 million on the phones.

01:19:50.890 --> 01:19:52.625
Do I hear $10 million?

01:19:52.659 --> 01:19:54.327
-$10 million? $10 million?
-Ten!

01:19:54.361 --> 01:19:56.329

Once, twice...

Sold... to the gentleman

01:19:59.299 --> 01:20:00.867
-from Indonesia.
-(applause)

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.901
Congratulations, sir.

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:06.639
-(whistles)
-(growling)

01:20:06.673 --> 01:20:08.908

-(screeching)
-(excited chatter)

01:20:10.944 --> 01:20:11.945
A juvenile...

01:20:11.978 --> 01:20:13.446
-allosaurus.
-(roars)

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:16.349
-(yelling, excited chatter)
-(chuckles) A fierce...

01:20:16.383 --> 01:20:18.451
and an aggressive predator.

01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:20.353
(snarls)

01:20:20.387 --> 01:20:22.489

01:20:25.258 --> 01:20:26.493

01:20:26.526 --> 01:20:27.994
Sold!

01:20:29.429 --> 01:20:31.898
Wonderful.

01:20:31.931 --> 01:20:33.066
Wonderful bidding.

01:20:33.099 --> 01:20:34.334
(snarls)

01:20:41.007 --> 01:20:43.877
(bellowing, growling)

01:20:47.447 --> 01:20:50.383
-You're good. Let's go.
-Move it out.

01:20:50.417 --> 01:20:52.919
-Here we go.
-Bring it on back. Let's go.

01:20:54.721 --> 01:20:55.689
(whistles)

01:20:55.722 --> 01:20:57.123
(pounding steps)

01:20:59.325 --> 01:21:01.294
-(grunts)
-OWEN (softly): Hey. Hey.

CLAIRE:
Okay.

01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:05.265
Hey. Hey, you.

-(grunting)
-Look at me. Look at me.

01:21:07.567 --> 01:21:09.069
Hey!

01:21:09.102 --> 01:21:11.037
Come with me. Come with me.

01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:13.273
Okay. There you go.

01:21:30.557 --> 01:21:32.959
You're welcome.

01:21:32.992 --> 01:21:35.195
(squeaky whimpering,
low grunting)

01:21:36.262 --> 01:21:38.231
(clattering in distance)

01:21:38.264 --> 01:21:40.300

01:21:49.075 --> 01:21:51.478
(whispers): That's
Lockwood's granddaughter.

01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:53.246
Hey.

01:21:53.279 --> 01:21:55.982
Hey, kid. You want
to come down out of there?

01:21:58.084 --> 01:22:01.054
-Uh...
-Uh...

01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:03.323
do you remember me?

01:22:03.356 --> 01:22:05.191
-(shuddering)
-Yeah?

01:22:05.225 --> 01:22:08.762
My name is Claire.
What's yours?

01:22:08.795 --> 01:22:11.131
Maisie.

01:22:11.164 --> 01:22:14.034
-Maisie Lockwood.
-Oh, Maisie.

01:22:14.067 --> 01:22:17.003
Well, this is my friend, Owen.

01:22:17.037 --> 01:22:19.272
(crying):
I saw you

01:22:19.305 --> 01:22:22.108
with the velociraptors.
Uh, Blue.

01:22:22.142 --> 01:22:24.544
Oh. Oh, yeah?

01:22:24.577 --> 01:22:28.348
Uh... y-you like dinosaurs?

01:22:29.649 --> 01:22:31.785
Hey, so do I.

01:22:31.818 --> 01:22:33.553
Tell you what,
you come on down from there,

01:22:33.586 --> 01:22:36.556
I'll tell you everything you
need to know about Blue, huh?

01:22:36.589 --> 01:22:38.625
That sound all right?

01:22:38.658 --> 01:22:40.360
All right, yeah.

01:22:40.393 --> 01:22:42.462
Come on down.

01:22:50.136 --> 01:22:52.505
Sweetie...

01:22:52.539 --> 01:22:54.574
we need some help
finding your grandfather.

01:22:54.607 --> 01:22:56.276
Can you take us to him?

01:22:56.309 --> 01:22:58.645
(sniffles)
No.

01:22:58.678 --> 01:23:00.647
You made it down here
all by yourself, huh?

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.284
Brave kid. Looks like
you could use a friend.

01:23:04.317 --> 01:23:06.219
He's gone.

01:23:07.287 --> 01:23:09.422

so, listen, I'll tell you what,

01:23:12.492 --> 01:23:14.828
we were just about to go
and find our friends

01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:16.563
and then get
the heck out of here.

01:23:16.596 --> 01:23:18.164
You want to come with us?

01:23:19.366 --> 01:23:21.668

-Sold!

01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:39.285
-(applause)
-And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:23:39.319 --> 01:23:42.255
that we are halfway
through the evening...

01:23:42.288 --> 01:23:43.857
(low growling)

01:23:43.890 --> 01:23:46.393
...we'd like to offer
a special treat

01:23:46.426 --> 01:23:48.395
to our...

01:23:48.428 --> 01:23:50.397
discriminating buyers.

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:53.233
This evening we will preview

01:23:53.266 --> 01:23:55.168
-(low growling)
-a new asset

01:23:55.201 --> 01:23:57.637
that we've been developing.

01:23:57.671 --> 01:23:59.673
A creature of the future

01:23:59.706 --> 01:24:02.442
made from pieces of the past.

01:24:02.475 --> 01:24:04.310
(excited chatter)

01:24:04.344 --> 01:24:06.546
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be warned,

01:24:06.579 --> 01:24:08.648
this is the perfect blend

01:24:08.682 --> 01:24:11.117
of the two
most dangerous creatures

01:24:11.151 --> 01:24:13.186
that have ever walked
the Earth.

01:24:13.219 --> 01:24:14.554
(hisses)

01:24:14.587 --> 01:24:15.889
We call it...

01:24:15.922 --> 01:24:18.324
the <i>Indoraptor.</i>

01:24:18.358 --> 01:24:20.593

(yelling, gasping)

01:24:40.613 --> 01:24:43.350
The perfect weapon
for the modern age.

01:24:43.383 --> 01:24:48.321
Built for combat, with
tactical responses more acute

01:24:48.355 --> 01:24:51.224
-than any human soldier.
-What is that thing?

01:24:51.257 --> 01:24:54.527
(screeching, growling)

01:24:55.695 --> 01:24:57.497
(electrical buzzing)

01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:59.466
(growling, huffing)

01:25:05.338 --> 01:25:07.640
(growling)

01:25:07.674 --> 01:25:09.609
MAISIE:
They made it.

01:25:09.642 --> 01:25:12.612
-Mr. Mills and the other man.
-What man?

01:25:14.347 --> 01:25:15.515
Him.

01:25:15.548 --> 01:25:18.585
EVERSOLL:
Designed by Mr. Henry Wu,

01:25:18.618 --> 01:25:21.488
with an intelligence quotient
comparable to the velociraptor,

01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:24.190
biospecs include
a heightened sense of smell,

01:25:24.224 --> 01:25:27.394
and trained to respond
to a pulse-coded

01:25:27.427 --> 01:25:29.662
laser targeting system,

01:25:29.696 --> 01:25:32.332
enabling it
to isolate and track prey

01:25:32.365 --> 01:25:34.234
in complex environments.

01:25:34.267 --> 01:25:35.335
Voilà!

01:25:38.638 --> 01:25:41.741
(low whirring growing louder)

01:25:41.775 --> 01:25:44.310
Now, first the laser sets

01:25:44.344 --> 01:25:45.679
the target.

01:25:45.712 --> 01:25:47.547
-(Indoraptor snarls)
-(people gasping)

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:50.283
And then once locked on,

01:25:50.316 --> 01:25:52.585
the acoustic signal
triggers the attack.

01:25:52.619 --> 01:25:54.320
-(electronic squealing)
-(screeches)

01:25:54.354 --> 01:25:57.357
(screaming, gasping)

01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:59.492
-(excited chatter)
-(chuckles)

01:25:59.526 --> 01:26:02.562
This animal is relentless.

01:26:02.595 --> 01:26:06.299
Now, modifications
are still being made...

01:26:06.332 --> 01:26:07.434
$20 millions!

01:26:07.467 --> 01:26:09.302

-21!
-Well...

01:26:16.443 --> 01:26:18.345
it is still a...

Do I hear 26?

01:26:34.294 --> 01:26:36.363

01:26:41.067 --> 01:26:42.402
This animal is not for sale.

01:26:42.435 --> 01:26:43.636
If you want
to create an addict,

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:45.038
you have to give them a taste.

01:26:45.071 --> 01:26:46.339
He's a prototype.

01:26:46.373 --> 01:26:47.440
Look, this prototype

01:26:47.474 --> 01:26:51.578
is worth $28 million right now.

01:26:51.611 --> 01:26:54.047
Relax. We'll make some more.

Mills, where are you?!

Holy cow.

What are you?

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.663
I didn't see you on the island.

Oh, you're a tough guy.

(hinges creaking)

01:30:43.843 --> 01:30:46.046
(breathing softly)

01:30:49.949 --> 01:30:52.719
Look at you.

01:30:52.752 --> 01:30:55.121
You're some kind of hot rod

01:30:55.155 --> 01:30:58.558
with really pretty teeth.

01:30:58.591 --> 01:31:01.895

-MILLS: Don't!

01:33:09.155 --> 01:33:11.124
You two,
you... deserve each other.

01:33:11.157 --> 01:33:12.992
Maisie, come with me.

01:33:13.026 --> 01:33:14.794
You got your money.

01:33:14.828 --> 01:33:15.995
Now, walk away.

01:33:16.029 --> 01:33:18.098
Oh, what are you gonna do, huh?

01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:20.100
We're gonna stop this.
All of it.

01:33:20.133 --> 01:33:22.135
How?! What, are you
gonna go back in time

01:33:22.168 --> 01:33:24.104
before Hammond decided
to play God?

01:33:24.137 --> 01:33:25.271
You can't put it
back in the box!

01:33:25.305 --> 01:33:27.107
-We have to try.
-It's too late.

01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.942
Maisie, come.

01:33:31.011 --> 01:33:33.680
Oh...

01:33:33.713 --> 01:33:36.216
so you're gonna take care
of her now, huh?

01:33:36.249 --> 01:33:39.152
You have no idea what she is.

01:33:39.185 --> 01:33:43.089
What do you think drove Hammond
and Lockwood apart? Huh?

01:33:43.123 --> 01:33:47.160
Lockwood never had
a grandchild.

01:33:47.193 --> 01:33:49.929
He just wanted
his daughter back.

01:33:52.098 --> 01:33:55.969
-And he had the technology.
-(panting softly)

01:33:56.002 --> 01:33:58.905
He created another.

01:33:58.938 --> 01:34:01.141
He made her again.

01:34:01.174 --> 01:34:02.676

-(Maisie screams)

01:34:04.144 --> 01:34:05.979

01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:12.719
Come on!

01:34:27.367 --> 01:34:29.169
Get this to Mills.

01:34:29.202 --> 01:34:31.171
Be very careful--
it's extremely valuable.

01:34:31.204 --> 01:34:33.773
You-- I need blood samples
from the raptor.

01:34:33.807 --> 01:34:35.942
Don't just stand there
like an idiot!

01:34:35.975 --> 01:34:38.511
Get me 50cc's carfentanil
and a phlebotomy kit!

01:34:38.545 --> 01:34:41.014
It's right there! Now!

01:34:41.047 --> 01:34:43.516
Come on, come on.

01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:45.251
I need this raptor's blood.

01:34:45.285 --> 01:34:47.053
-(snarls)
-Oh! For God...

01:34:47.087 --> 01:34:49.155
Sure, go ahead.

01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:51.224
Where is that kit?!

01:34:51.257 --> 01:34:52.859
Okay, now, listen to me.

01:34:52.892 --> 01:34:54.527
It is better for you
to cooperate.

01:34:54.561 --> 01:34:57.964
I'm gonna get this blood,
with or without your help.

01:34:57.997 --> 01:34:59.199
This blood's contaminated.

01:34:59.232 --> 01:35:01.334
I designed this animal myself.

01:35:01.368 --> 01:35:03.136
It's pure.

01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:04.771
Every cell of her body

01:35:04.804 --> 01:35:06.239
was created in the most
controlled environment,

01:35:06.272 --> 01:35:09.809
-under the most demanding
of conditions. -(exhales)

01:35:09.843 --> 01:35:11.811
Yeah, but I did an intravenous
blood transfusion

01:35:11.845 --> 01:35:14.381
with a T. rex, so...
it's a sock drawer in there.

01:35:14.414 --> 01:35:16.916
You what?

01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:18.852

What are you doing?!

If it reaches

it'll kill them all.

She won't hurt us.

01:55:21.354 --> 01:55:24.024
(purring)

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.329
(Blue panting)

01:55:35.602 --> 01:55:37.337
Hey.

01:55:37.370 --> 01:55:40.240
(Blue purrs)

01:55:44.511 --> 01:55:46.579
Blue, come with me.

01:55:51.584 --> 01:55:54.587
We'll take you
to a safe place, okay?

01:55:58.124 --> 01:56:00.260
(purring)

01:56:08.601 --> 01:56:10.470
(shrieks)

01:56:19.279 --> 01:56:21.381
(chitters)

01:56:25.118 --> 01:56:26.486
(shrieks in distance)

01:56:35.261 --> 01:56:36.629
MALCOLM:
<i>How many times</i>

01:56:36.663 --> 01:56:38.665
<i>do you have to</i>
<i>see the evidence?</i>

01:56:38.698 --> 01:56:41.534
<i>How many times</i>
<i>must the point be made?</i>

01:56:41.568 --> 01:56:43.169
(roaring)

01:56:43.203 --> 01:56:45.271
<i>We're causing</i>
<i>our own extinction.</i>

01:56:45.305 --> 01:56:49.409
<i>Too many red lines</i>
<i>have been crossed.</i>

01:56:49.442 --> 01:56:51.177
<i>And our home has,</i>

01:56:51.211 --> 01:56:53.513
<i>in fundamental ways,</i>
<i>been polluted by</i>

01:56:53.546 --> 01:56:58.251
avarice and political
megalomania.

01:56:58.284 --> 01:57:01.554
<i>Genetic power has now</i>
<i>been unleashed,</i>

01:57:01.588 --> 01:57:04.290
<i>and of course,</i>
<i>that's gonna be catastrophic.</i>

01:57:04.324 --> 01:57:05.358
<i>This change was inevitable</i>

01:57:05.392 --> 01:57:07.627
<i>from the moment we brought</i>
<i>the first dinosaur</i>

01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:09.262
<i>back from extinction.</i>

01:57:09.295 --> 01:57:10.630
(roars)

01:57:10.663 --> 01:57:12.298
We convince ourselves
that sudden change

01:57:12.332 --> 01:57:13.500
is something that happens

01:57:13.533 --> 01:57:14.868
outside the normal order
of things,

01:57:14.901 --> 01:57:16.569
like a... car crash,

01:57:16.603 --> 01:57:18.705
or that it's beyond
our control,

01:57:18.738 --> 01:57:20.240
like a fatal illness.

01:57:20.273 --> 01:57:21.307
We don't conceive of sudden,

01:57:21.341 --> 01:57:24.177
<i>radical, irrational change</i>

01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:26.413
<i>as woven into the very fabric</i>
<i>of existence.</i>

01:57:26.446 --> 01:57:31.184
<i>Yet, I can assure you,</i>
<i>it most assuredly is.</i>

01:57:31.217 --> 01:57:33.353
<i>And it's happening now.</i>

01:57:35.722 --> 01:57:40.560
<i>Humans and dinosaurs are now</i>
<i>gonna be forced to coexist.</i>

01:57:40.593 --> 01:57:42.128
(bellows)

01:57:43.663 --> 01:57:46.666
<i>These creatures were here</i>
<i>before us.</i>

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:49.736
<i>And if we're not careful,</i>
<i>they're gonna be here after.</i>

01:57:49.769 --> 01:57:54.341
(both roaring)

01:57:55.408 --> 01:57:56.910
<i>We're gonna have to adjust</i>

01:57:56.943 --> 01:57:59.379
<i>to new threats</i>
<i>that we can't imagine.</i>

01:58:03.183 --> 01:58:05.618
(screeching)

01:58:05.652 --> 01:58:09.222
We've entered a new era.

01:58:09.255 --> 01:58:12.359
Welcome to Jurassic World.

01:58:12.392 --> 01:58:14.327
* *

01:58:26.539 --> 01:58:27.707
(sniffing)

01:58:27.741 --> 01:58:31.177
(yelping)

01:58:40.754 --> 01:58:42.689

01:59:10.784 --> 01:59:12.719

01:59:30.804 --> 01:59:32.739

02:00:00.834 --> 02:00:02.769

02:00:30.864 --> 02:00:32.799

02:01:00.894 --> 02:01:02.829
* *

02:01:30.924 --> 02:01:32.859
* *

02:02:00.954 --> 02:02:02.889
* *

02:02:30.984 --> 02:02:32.919
* *

02:03:01.014 --> 02:03:02.949
* *

02:03:31.044 --> 02:03:32.979
* *

02:04:01.074 --> 02:04:03.009
* *

02:04:31.104 --> 02:04:33.039
* *

02:05:01.134 --> 02:05:03.069
* *

02:05:31.164 --> 02:05:33.099
* *

02:06:01.194 --> 02:06:03.129
* *

02:06:31.224 --> 02:06:33.159
* *

02:07:01.254 --> 02:07:03.189
* *

02:07:31.284 --> 02:07:33.219
* *

02:07:54.908 --> 02:07:57.777
(screeching)

02:07:57.811 --> 02:07:58.978
(horns honking)

02:07:59.012 --> 02:08:00.280
(screeching)

02:08:00.313 --> 02:08:03.750
(sirens wailing)

02:08:03.783 --> 02:08:05.719
(screeching continues)
